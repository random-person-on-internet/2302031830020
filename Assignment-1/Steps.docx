Steps to Create a GIT Repository and Organize Folders:

1. **Create the Repository on GitHub:**  
   - Go to https://github.com/ and sign in to your account.  
   - Click the New button to create a new repository.  
   - Set the repository name as your enrollment number: 2302031830020.  
   - Select Public or Private as needed.  
   - Check the Initialize this repository with a README option.  
   - Click Create repository.

2. Clone the Repository to Your Desktop:  
   Open Git Bash or your terminal and run the following command:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/random-person-on-internet/2302031830020.git
   ``` 

3. Create .gitkeep Files in Each Folder:
   This ensures Git recognizes the empty folders when pushing changes.  

4. Stage Changes:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. Commit the Changes: 
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit with folder structure"
   ```

6. Push to GitHub:  
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
